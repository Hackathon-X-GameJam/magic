# Liphium Magic: Test your applications with confidence.

This project contains lots of experimental tools for database testing and more. None of the tools in this repository are fully featured and tested, please use with caution and do not use in mission-critical projects.

The goal of Liphium Magic is to built a testing toolkit so powerful that testing software is actually fun. Unit testing is easy and can be a nice way to test your projects. I want to make testing your complex backend just as easy as unit testing.
